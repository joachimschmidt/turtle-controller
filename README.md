## Turtle controller
### Contoller App in flutter working with dart server and minecraft turtle using websockets

>/mobile contains code for flutter app working both on mobile and web. To create 3D view I've used package zflutter - pseudo 3D engine

>/server contains dart server serving as middleman between player and turtle.

>/minecraft contains turtle scripts in lua for evaluating incoming commands
